This code is used to calculate helmfree energy
Code is taken from phasego-3.0.0
It requires ve-0 and and dos files as input
It produces tf.dat file as output which contains temperatures and helmfree energy with different volumes


Input
______
a folder which contains dos files
ve-0 file

change these parameter values in helmfree.py file
Formula_Name = 'CaO'
Names_of_Strs = 'fcc'
VE_data_File_Name = 've-0'
inppath = 'inp-fcc-CaO'
outdir = './'
Unit_of_Freq = 'Ha'
num_formula_units = 1


Process
_______
python helmfree.py



Output
______
tf.dat
