This code finds the runtime of vasp job after specific time steps.
It is a two step process
using outcar we create a out.txt file which contains time taken by every iteration
using out.txt we find time after specific intervals.


Input
__________
OUTCAR



Process
_________

To create out.txt use this command
grep -ir "LOOP+:  cpu time" OUTCAR > out.txt

To find time after specific interval use command 
python adv_time_count.py

note: by default it finds time after 500 time steps. if you want to change it, goto line 13 in adv_time_count.py and
change 500 to any other value.




Output
_________
No.ofSteps= 500 Time= 87338.64799999996
No.ofSteps= 1000 Time= 173256.23600000018
